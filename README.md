# Building a Statistical-Based and LSTM-Based Anomaly Detection Algorithm

Built a statistical-based algorithm using Gaussian Distribution to detect anomalies in a confidential dataset provided, followed by building an LSTM-based model to detect anomalies. Both methods were evaluated and compared against each other, as well as against SVM and K-NN. Code is available in Python, and the `Assignment_Instructions.pdf` details the entire assignment in this repo. This is my assignment work for ECE9609B Machine Learning course offered at Western University in Winter 2020 by Dr. Abdallah Shami.
